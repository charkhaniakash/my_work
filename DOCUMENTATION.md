# Micro-Influencer Marketplace: Comprehensive Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Micro-Influencer Marketplace is a web platform designed to streamline the process of connecting brands with micro-influencers for collaborative marketing campaigns. It provides a dedicated environment for brands to initiate campaigns and discover suitable influencers, and for influencers to find campaign opportunities and manage their collaborations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional methods of identifying, engaging, and managing micro-influencers are often manual, time-consuming, and inefficient for both brands and influencers. Brands struggle to:

*   Discover relevant micro-influencers with authentic engagement within specific niches.
*   Manage communication, applications, and contracts across multiple influencer collaborations.
*   Track campaign performance and ensure deliverables are met.

Micro-influencers, on the other hand, face challenges in:

*   Finding legitimate and relevant paid collaboration opportunities.
*   Effectively showcasing their value and pitching to brands.
*   Managing multiple applications and tracking their statuses.
*   Ensuring timely payment for their work.

This marketplace aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, efficient, and transparent platform for both parties.

*   **Authentication:** Handled by Supabase Auth, providing secure user registration and session management.
